================================================

Run ID: 003
Model: Gemini-2.5-Pro
Timestamp: 2025-11-09T00:00:00Z
Output Directory: ./out_003_Gemini-2.5-Pro

Tools/Packages Used:
- js-beautify
- espree
- acorn
- @typescript-eslint/typescript-estree
- ajv-cli

File Counts:
- Original JS files analyzed: 2 (h0.js, h1-check.js)
- Beautified files: 2 (h0.beautified.js, h1-check.beautified.js)
- Total chunks analyzed: 101
- Service worker: 1 file (h0.js)
- Content scripts: 1 file (h1-check.js)
- UI files: 1 file (popover/popover.html)

Analysis Results:
- Chrome API calls found: 40+ unique calls
- Event listeners: 30+
- Message channels: 50+
- Storage keys: 100+
- Network endpoints: 100+ (REST and GraphQL)
- Workflows identified: 2
- Privacy risks: 3 high/medium severity

Beautification:
- Success: 2 files
- Errors: 0 files
- Files excluded: Other JS files not part of core service worker/content script analysis.

Validation:
- honey_summary.json: PASSED schema validation
- outline.jsonl: 101 entries (all chunks covered)
- analysis_notes.md: Complete, all chunks documented
- CSV files: endpoints.csv (180+ rows), messages.csv (50+ rows), storage_keys.csv (100+ rows)

Known Gaps/Unknowns:
- The purpose of many storage keys is inferred and not explicitly documented in the code.
- The full payload schema for many message channels could not be determined.
- The analysis focused on the primary service worker and content script; other UI-related scripts were not deeply analyzed.

Completion Status: SUCCESS
